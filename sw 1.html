			<td>If there’s anything that can prove there’s at least an ounce of purity and good in this world, it’s a Golden Retriever puppy. Maybe you’ve checked out the Golden Retriever puppies in the pictures above and are already feeling the warm fuzzies in your heart.Golden Retrievers are somehow both majestic and completely silly; they’re simultaneously big ol’ goofballs and compassionate listeners.</td>

			<th> <img src="Japanese Spitz.jpg" width="150" height="148"></th>
			<td>The Japanese Spitz is a small family companion with the heart of a large watchdog. This breed may look similar to American Eskimo Dogs, white Pomeranians, or small Samoyeds, but Japanese Spitzes have their own lineages and hail from, as you might guess, Japan. Although the American Kennel Club does not recognize this breed, many other kennel clubs around the world accept them.</td>
